# Android-educational-app "Pick Sum"


The task is to design an educational game for high school kids (years 7-8) that helps them with maths. Kids of those ages understand how to use GUI interfaces and they expect to be fast with engaging graphics, animations, and sounds. The app GUI design should be intuitive, clear, responsive, and visually interesting. Moreover, children at those year levels are introduced to a variety of analytical thinking skills and problem-solving skills at school for which traditional teaching styles have become less effective for the modern generations. The app should include puzzles that rely on some combination of memory, pattern recognition, and the app should promote patience. The app is expected to have four screens: 1) landing page, 2) game screen, 3) settings screen, and 4) high scores screen. Additionally, the app should include some interesting use of sensor programming, and social network integration.
